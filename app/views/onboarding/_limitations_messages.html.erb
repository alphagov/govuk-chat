  <p>Hello ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m GOV.UK Chat. Iâ€™m an experimental tool that uses AI to answer questions and help you find information on GOV.UK. I have limitations that you need to be aware of.</p>
<% end %>

<% limitations_message_2 = capture do %>
  <p>The biggest limitation of AI tools like me is a problem known as â€˜hallucinationâ€™.</p>
  <p>This means we sometimes make up false information or facts but present them to you confidently.</p>
<% end %>

<% limitations_message_3 = capture do %>
  <p>To check if my answers are right, use the links I provide to official guidance on GOV.UK.</p>
  <p>Never act on what Iâ€™ve told you without checking GOV.UK.</p>
<% end %>
