Hello,

You now have access to GOV.UK Chat, an experimental tool that helps you find answers to your questions about business and trade.

## Get started

You can use the unique link below to get started. It's valid for <%= magic_link_timeout_hours %> hours and can only be used once.

[Start chatting](<%= @magic_link %>)

## How to use GOV.UK Chat

To return to GOV.UK Chat, visit [gov.uk/chat/conversation](<%= show_conversation_url %>) at any point in the next <%= session_timeout_days %> days.

You'll need to [get a new link for GOV.UK Chat](<%= homepage_url %>) if:

* you want to use GOV.UK Chat on a different browser or device
* your access has expired after <%= session_timeout_days %> days

## Get the most out of GOV.UK Chat

Start a new chat whenever you ask about something new.

This will remove your previous messages and make your answers more accurate.

This is because GOV.UK Chat uses your previous messages as context to interpret and answer new questions.

From the GOV.UK Chat menu, you can:

* save your chat history
* start a new chat

If you need help accessing GOV.UK Chat, reply to this email.

Kind regards,
Government Digital Service
