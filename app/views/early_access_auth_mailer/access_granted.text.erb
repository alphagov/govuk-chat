Hello,

You now have access to GOV.UK Chat, an experimental tool that helps you find answers to your questions about business and trade.

## Get started

You can use the unique link below to get started. You'll need to use it within <%= @magic_link_timeout_hours %> hours to activate your account.

[Start chatting](<%= @magic_link %>)

## How to use GOV.UK Chat

To get the most accurate answers, start a new chat whenever you ask about something new.

This is because GOV.UK Chat uses what it's learned from your previous messages to answer new questions. This means that if you change topics without clearing your last chat, the quality of GOV.UK Chat's answers can be affected.

To start a new chat, use the 'Start new chat' button in the header. To save your conversation first, use the 'Print or save this chat' option in the menu.

## When you're done chatting

Use the 'Share your feedback' link in the footer to tell us about your conversation with GOV.UK Chat.

This will take around 5 minutes.

## Get a new link to GOV.UK Chat

You'll need to [get a new link for GOV.UK Chat](<%= homepage_url %>) if:

* you want to use GOV.UK Chat on a different browser or device
* your access has expired after <%= @session_timeout_days %> days
* you've signed out of GOV.UK Chat

If you need help accessing GOV.UK Chat, reply to this email.

Kind regards,
Government Digital Service
